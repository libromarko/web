_Sep 6, 2022_

We couldn't take it anymore and we are here with our first working version.
We know that from now on, we can develop the application faster with our users, supporters and followers.

We are currently live as a browser add-on and a web application.
We will share our android and ios versions with you very soon.

With this version, you can customize your bookmarks as you wish.

When using the application, remember that this is an alpha version and you may encounter crashes.
You will definitely encounter errors while using the application, do not hesitate to tell us about them.
We will be with you again very soon with new announcements.

Thanks for your help. Enjoyable uses. 🎉
